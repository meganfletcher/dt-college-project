# dt-college-project
An application for The Daily Texan in progress created with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and D3.js that will allow users to guess what college at UT Austin has the most in-person, hybrid and online classes. The user can choose if they want to guess on face-to-face, hybrid or online learning formats through three buttons. After clicking a button, they can select a UT Austin college from the dropdown menu to make their guess. Once they clicked on a college, text will appear to let them know if they were correct, close or wrong. A bar chart will also appear so the user can look through how all the colleges rank in comparison with eachother.
